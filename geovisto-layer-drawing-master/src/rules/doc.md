# Rules

---

This folder contains what I call _rules_. They are not functions per se, but they create relations between objects. At the moment,
rules apply on polygons, because of the kinds of rules, that are implemented.

## Implemented Rules:

- difference of polygons
- union of polygons
- intersect of polygons
